# MoodleXMLGenerator
generates XML-files for moodle-Quizes

I started this tool to create Quiz-Files for moodle-Tests with a bunch of questions of the same type but with different values. Soon I added a simple way to create multiple-choice-Questions from simple Text-Files (I know there is much similar code) but I prefer to keep knowledge about how the fraction for right and wrong answers are set.

If you like, you can use the code for your own purposes. The help/documentation is very low but I hope most of the features are self-explanatory.
